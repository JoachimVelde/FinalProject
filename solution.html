            In LiveMarine project, there are 10 underwater high resolution cameras that are mounted to floating
            bases in the Pacific Ocean. The cameras monitor the environment, such as moving fish stocks, animals 
            in that habitat as well as rare passengers. They live stream and record to the research base where 
            all data is analysed simultaneously.
