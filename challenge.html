            <h1>Global Challenge</h1>
            <p>
                The integrity of marine and coastal ecosystems is challenged by the consequences
                of climate changes, such as ocean warming, acidification and oxygen loss; marine pollution
                by microplastic and harmful chemical waste, as well as unsustainable fishing.
            </p>    
            <p>
                The oceans absorb 23% of CO2 generated by human activity and more than 90% of the
                excess heat in our climate system. Increase of ocean temperature and generation of heat waves
                threaten marine ecosystems depending on stable water temperature and are one of the major causes 
                coral reef deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around 5 to 12 billion metric tonnes of plastic enters the ocean every year. About 89% of plastic 
                waste found on ocean floor are single use items. This costs the world an estimate of &#36 13 billion
                per year, along with the clean-up costs and economical loss in fishing and other industries 
                <a href="references.html">[Reference 2]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overfishing together with bycatch, the capture of unwanted sea life while fishing for a different species,
                is one of the biggest drivers of decrease in marine wildlife populations. It causes not only an imbalance
                in the marine food chain that are closely tied through the food web, but also threatens the livelihood of
                over 3 billion people <a href="references.html">[Reference 3]</a>.
