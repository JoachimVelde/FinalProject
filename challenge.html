        <p>
            The integrity of marine and coastal ecosystems is challenged by the consequences
            of climate changes, such as ocean warming, acidification and oxygen loss; marine pollution
            by microplastic and harmful chemical waste, as well as unsustainable fishing.
        </p>    
        <p>
            The oceans absorb 23% of CO2 generated by human activity and more than 90% of the
            excess heat in our climate system. Increase of ocean temperature and generation of heat waves
            threaten marine ecosystems depending on stable water temperature and are one of the major causes 
            coral reef deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 5 to 12 billion metric tonnes of plastic enters the ocean every year. About 89% of plastic 
            waste found on ocean floor are single use items. This costs the world an estimate of &#36 13 billion
            per year, along with the clean-up costs and economical loss in fishing and other industries

        </p>
        <p>
            Overfishing together with bycatch, the capture of unwanted sea life while fishing for a different species,
            is one of the biggest drivers of decrease in marine wildlife populations. It causes not only an imbalance
            in the marine food chain that are closely tied through the food web, but also threatens the livelihood of
            over 3 billion people <a href="references.html#reference3">[Reference 3]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            UN aims by 2030 to reduce marine pollution and address its consequences, such as minimizing ocean acidification.
            UNs pogram also includes ending of overfishing as well as illegal fishing and fishing practices. Conservation of 
            marine biodiversity and ecological systems though implementation of sustainable management systems and increased 
            scientific research and knowlegde are among other goals.UN-Oceans is an inter-agency mechanism that seeks to enhance the coordination, coherence and effectiveness 
            of competent organizations of the United Nations system and the International Seabed Authority, in conformity
            with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the respective competences of each of its participating
            organizations and the mandates and priorities approved by their respective governing bodies.
